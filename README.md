# Concrete-Image-Classification
This project aims to create a machine learning model by using transfer learning to classify concrete images as either positive (with a crack) or negative (without a crack). The model will be created in Python using Pytorch and tracks metrics using wandb. The dataset was obtained from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2.
